					You may have taken out one Hufflepuff second-year, but more

					<i className="fas fa-hat-wizard ravenclaw" />{" "}
					<i className="fas fa-hat-wizard slytherin" /> and find

					experience and skills. If you do suffer any damage, there
					may be a few potions <i className="fas fa-flask potion" />{" "}
					around the castle that can help you.
